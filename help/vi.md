# vi Plugin

**vi** is a plugin that provides a simple vi-style modal editing mode.

## Usage

To enter vi mode, press `Escape` or run:

```
vi
```

When in vi **command mode**, the keybindings follow a vi-like style.
You can return to insert mode with the `i` command.

### vi.default Option

You can make micro start in vi command mode by default using:

```
videfault true
```

To disable it again:

```
videfault false
```

Without arguments, the `videfault` command toggles the setting.

This setting is saved globally and applies to all newly opened buffers.

## Notes

- Word movement (`w`, `b`) uses microâ€™s `WordRight` and `WordLeft` logic and
  may not fully match vi behavior.
- This plugin is a **proof of concept**, and not a full vi clone.
